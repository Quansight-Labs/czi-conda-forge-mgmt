## Transparent, open & sustainable infrastructure for conda-forge and bioconda

The conda-forge and bioconda projects were founded in 2015 in response to frustrations scientific software users consistently faced when attempting to install system package dependencies. Installing open-source software packages with binary dependencies is frequently a multistep process involving an intricate sequence of software compilation.
The emergence of conda-forge massively reduced the scientific packaging toil by building on transparency, automation, compatibility and open-source principles.
As a result, its community has grown exponentially, as has the number of artifacts hosted and downloaded (~18 thousand packages hosted and ~300 million package downloads/month).

Such growth has significantly increased the pressure on its underlying infrastructure, tooling, and maintainers' workflow.
Besides, this entire infrastructure and community solely rely on the anaconda.org service as a hosting provider.

This project aims to improve the long-term sustainability of the conda-forge/bioconda projects and their ecosystem through three main work items or missions.
These have been identified with the following `mission: *` labels:

* [`mission: infra üõ†`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/labels/mission%3A%20infra%20%F0%9F%9B%A0): [Reducing technical debt with Infrastructure as Code approaches](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/issues/1).
* [`mission: mirror ü™û`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/labels/mission%3A%20mirror%20%F0%9F%AA%9E): [Enabling mirroring capabilities with OCI-based storage](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/issues/22).
* [`mission: dashboard üéõ`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/labels/mission%3A%20dashboard%20%F0%9F%8E%9B): [Building a maintainers dashboard with Quetz](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/issues/13).

## üìÖ Estimated completion

The project is scheduled to take approximately two years, from December 2022 to January 2025.
We have established time-based milestones at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
Some tasks are labeled as `stretch` goals in case there's time and resources to tackle them.

These milestones are available in the project [Milestones tab](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt/milestones).

## üë• Community

The team meets once a month as part of the "Mamba Meet" sessions.
<!-- WIP: More specific details about the meetings -->

Meeting notes are publicly available under [`meeting-notes/`](meeting-notes/).
