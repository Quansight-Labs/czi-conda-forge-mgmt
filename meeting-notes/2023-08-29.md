## üìù Agenda

- [ ] Yearly reports for CZI in early October:
  - [ ] Either update issues on https://github.com/quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt
  - [ ] Or share the monthly updates so we can compile a yearly report.
- [ ] The future of regro/libcfgraph:
  - https://github.com/quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-db has a significant overlap with `conda/conda-index` SQLite cache, so we are in touch with Anaconda to see if those can be published directly. It's only missing the `files` database to query to which package a given file belongs.
- [ ] Darian onboarded the dashboard team and we met with the conda-forge.org frontpage team to align scopes and future directions in terms of style guide, etc. We also agreed on backend constraints. 
- [ ] Matt Becker started a YAML-based approach for conda-forge repodata patches. It used to be a single Python script dealing with all the transformation, with added maintenance burden. Now, each patch is a separate YAML file and we can validate that with a Pydantic model (which is what we did at Quansight). We also added pydantic models to conda-smithy.
- [ ] OCI: 
  - New API for downloading in `mamba` is merged.
  - Also started the work for mirroring support.
