# 2024-06-25 CZI EOSS 5 conda-forge grant meeting

## 👥 Attendees

_Async_


## 📝 Agenda

- [ ] Hind:
    - Add tests and documentation for OCI registries and mirrors (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/pull/3307)
    - Handle packages names mapping between what's allowed in OCI registries and conda (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/pull/3310)
    - Ctrl+C / SIGINT / KeyboardInterrupt handling (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/pull/3309). More refactoring work upcoming on this.
    - Mamba2.0.0beta3 release is out (including all above).
    - Update OCI CEP (https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/70) (Should we merge it?)
- [ ] Jaime:
    - Added cph list support in conda-smithy and staged-recipes (this subcommand was added to conda-package-handling in the last release). This lists the contents of the artifacts with no extraction overhead. Perfect for code reviews!
    - Minor memory fixes in conda-metadata-app
    - The conda-forge-paths database now self-updates every week
    - I fixed the 404 errors in OCI mirroring (a couple issues still pending, please check mirrormirror issue tracker)
    - The conda-forge bots now 🚀 emoji-react to the @conda-forge-admin comments like pre-commit.ci does
    - A couple more infrastructure diagrams in the docs
