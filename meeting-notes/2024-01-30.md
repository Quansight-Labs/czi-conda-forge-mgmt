## üìù Agenda

- [ ] Jaime:
  - [ ] New features in conda-metadata-app
  - [ ] Onboarding core members automation
  - [ ] Added CPU runners to the open-gpu-server (e.g. for pytorch)
  - [ ] Set up a little server on top of open-gpu-server to host some extra infra (files to artifact mapping API?)
  - [ ] For context, progress on conda-forge.org revamp: frontpage, blog, announcements.
  
- [ ] Darian:
  - [ ] Demo of progress on developer dashboard
  - [ ] Discussion on the handling of URLs via a plugin.
    - [ ] Weird issue on production previews: flashing 404 before the migration page loads.
  - [ ] LocalStorage details to keep state around while changing pages.
- [ ] Sylvain:
  - [ ] OCI mirrors implementation in mamba.
  - [ ] No concept of "mirror" in conda. The same server in two locations are considered different channels. Big refactore needed to account for the fact that one channel can be served by different locations. e.g. fastest to respond.
  - [ ] Almost ready: https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/pull/3157. All green.
  - [ ] Will be available in libmamba 2.0.0alpha2
