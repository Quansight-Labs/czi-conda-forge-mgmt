## 📝 Agenda

- [ ] Introductions and teams
    - [ ] Missing from Quansight [Vinicius D. Cerutti](https://github.com/viniciusdc)
- [ ] Reporting obligations:
    - NumFOCUS: Separate monthly reports
    - CZI: Joint yearly reports (next due September 2023)
- [ ] [The project management repository](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-conda-forge-mgmt) 
    - Missions, milestones and issues
    - Using `team: *` labels to tag your work (required for automated reports)
    - Adding details to `WIP` descriptions
    - [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/10/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- [ ] Communication strategy
    - "Big"/important decisions - in the GH issues and [consent-based decision making process](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/consent-decision-making/) including the conda-forge and bioconda core teams as often as needed (from planning to execution)
    - Suggested approach:
        - Periodic meetings: frequency, attendance
        - Async predominantly in the GH issues for transparency
        - Slack channel available too for quick exchanges, but no decisions there.

## 🚀 Action items

- [ ] Publish the meeting notes in the project repo
