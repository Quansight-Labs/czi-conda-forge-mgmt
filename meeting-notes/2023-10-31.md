# 2023-10-31 CZI EOSS 5 conda-forge grant meeting

> This catch-up happened async. Reporting here for transparency.

## üìù Agenda

- Jaime: 
    - CEP-12 run_exports.json metadata being used in regro/conda-forge-feedstock-check-solvable. This is the last part we had to migrate from the deprecated libcfgraph repository.
    - Improvements in [conda-metadata-app](https://conda-metadata-app.streamlit.app/). It doesn't need to wait for OCI syncs for `.conda` metadata. `.tar.bz2` is still fetched from OCI because it cannot be streamed.
    - Bot errors in conda-forge.org/status (the old one) now use correctly formatted libmamba conflicts.
- Hind:
    - Some more progress and reviews for the OCI mirror integrations in mamba ([see PR](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/pull/2795)).
- Darian:
    - Progress in the dashboard implementation ([see PR](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/cf-infra-docs/pull/12)). Using JSX components so it matches the Docusaurus site.
