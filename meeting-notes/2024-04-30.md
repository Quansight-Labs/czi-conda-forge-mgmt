## üìù Agenda

- [X] Hind:
    - I've been working on the OCI registry support on mamba in order to test it, we are able to download the repodata.json file but not the specs, so that's WIP.
    - I also added the CEP-15 implementation in mamba. For now, it's supported when using simdjson for parsing (which is the default), but it is not implemented in libsolv yet (so parsing with it doesn't support the CEP) (see the issue mentioned in the PR). 
        - https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps/pull/70
- [X] Jaime:
    - Security improvements in the infrastructure
    - Engaged with the NumFocus Security/infra team
    - More infra docs than ever in https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure/
    - Discussion of docs restructuring in https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2164
- [X] Sylvain:
    - Update on Mamba 2.0
        - Crtl-C
        - OCI registry
    - Update on contracts
