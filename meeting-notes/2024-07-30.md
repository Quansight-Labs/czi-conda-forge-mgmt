## üìù Agenda

- [ ] Jaime:
    - Polished conda-metadata-app a little bit (some bugs Axel discovered)
    - Helped with the Status page reviews (we are almost done with the meta issue! Thanks Florence!)
    - Added a `GithubReleases` provider for the conda-forge version update bots (https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/2837)
    - Debugged the libmamba v2 RCs and provided feedback in the chat. RC0 was all-green but RC1 introduced some MatchSpec parsing regressions.
- [ ] Hind:
    - Fixed issues on mamba 2.0
    - Mamba 2.0.0rc1 release
- [ ] Florence:
    - Mostly done with status page items. Only two left: table headers and paused migrators.
    - Table headers being worked this week.
    - Jaime to work on paused migrators backend changes while Florence is away.

## üöÄ Action items

    - Need to go through the OCI CEP + call a vote
        - Start new PR based on Wolf's to make it easier to address feedback
